![rbm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d468d22a-2e51-47ab-a1d6-8763f0dd535d)

Reputation Bar Display: Show the current reputation level, progress, and faction name clearly.

Customizable Size: Allow players to resize the bar according to their preference, with minimum and maximum width and height options.

Movable Interface: Enable drag-and-drop functionality to reposition the bar anywhere on the screen.

Texture Selection: Offer a selection of different textures for the bar, such as standard, glossy, or textured appearances, allowing players to choose what suits their UI style.

Color Customization: Allow players to change the colors for the different reputation levels (e.g., friendly, honored, revered) for better visibility.

Addon is missing features I would like to add later like removing text labels but Its nothing I'm focusing on at the moment.
